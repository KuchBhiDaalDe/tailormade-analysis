problem?

when we place an order for a customized product, the usual means of communication are either telephonic conversations or
visiting the service provider. this process consumes a lot of time and energy on the service provider side.

customer does not know the current status of their order.


solution!

service provider can update the statuses of the orders on an app which can notify the customers as well. customers can provide
reviews, view previous work of the service provider, rate/upvote/downvote other reviews so that future customers see helpful reviews first.
customer can locate services, filter based on distance radius, orders, reviews.

this reduces the service providers time spent on phone calls.
increases the audience which can view the service providers work.
increases transparency to the customer.


how?

provider builds a skill catalogue which is visible to customers
provider enters a new order, adds steps until order completion, attach skill, attach customer contact
customer notified about the order
once or twice a day or as per need, provider updates the status of orders, moving them along the steps towards completion
